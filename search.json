    "title": "James Shields was the Backbone of the 2014 Royals Starting Pitching",
    "section": "",
    "text": "But the Royals had to make the World Series somehow, and James Shields was the workhorse of the Royals pitching staff. James Shields was traded to the Kansas City Royals from the Tampa Bay Rays along with bullpen ace Wade Davis, for Rookie of the Year winner Wil Meyers and Jake Odorizzi. The Royals knew they were close to contending and grabbing Shields was their signal to fans they cared about winning.\nBut Shields wasn’t the best pitcher in the MLB, and the Royals didn’t need him to be. He was consistent and was an innings eater. He didn’t allow a ton of runs either, being a guy who threw every 5 days, finishing with over 200 innings.\nBut how did Shields compare in ERA+ with the top 25 starters in 2014?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(scales)\n\npitchers <- read_csv(\"2014eraleaders.csv\")\n\nkershaw <- pitchers %>% filter(Name == \"Clayton Kershaw*\")\nlester <- pitchers %>% filter(Name == \"Jon Lester*\")\nshields <- pitchers %>% filter(Name == \"James Shields\")\n\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(\n    data=pitchers, \n    aes(\n      x=reorder(Name, -`ERA+`), \n      weight=`ERA+`\n      ), fill=\"light grey\") +\n  geom_bar(\n    data=shields, \n    aes(\n      x=reorder(Name, -`ERA+`), \n      weight=`ERA+`\n      ), fill=\"#BD9B60\"\n    ) + \n  geom_bar(\n    data=kershaw, \n    aes(\n      x=reorder(Name, -`ERA+`), \n      weight=`ERA+`\n      ), fill=\"#005A9C\"\n  ) +\n geom_bar(\n    data=lester, \n    aes(\n      x=reorder(Name, -`ERA+`), \n      weight=`ERA+`\n      ), fill=\"#003831\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels=comma) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Pitchers\",\n    y=\"ERA+\",\n    title=\"Leaders in ERA+ in the MLB in 2014\",\n    subtitle=\"James Shields was slightly above average, but he was no Kershaw\",\n    caption=\"Source: https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/majors/2014-standard-pitching.shtml | By: Jackson Reddick\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n    theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.x = element_blank()\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the ERA+ statistic is a pitcher’s ERA adjusted to their respective ballparks. Looking at Kershaw’s at the top is an absolute god like number at almost 200. League average is 100, so Shields sitting at 123 is a respective number for an ace pitcher. Lester sitting at 156 showed why he was such a tough matchup for the Royals offense in the AL Wild Card Game.\nFor me, looking at a pitchers WHIP statistic tells a big story about how good of a pitcher they are. Combining walks and hits allowed per inning into a statistic is a huge measuring stick to how good of a pitcher they are. So, let’s take a look at James Shields compared to the Top 25 pitchers in the MLB in 2014.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nmlbpitchers <- read_csv(\"2014royalssp.csv\")\n\nwhip <- mlbpitchers %>% \n  group_by(Name) %>% \n  summarise(\n    Innings = sum(IP), \n    TotalWHIP = sum(WHIP)\n    ) %>% na.omit()\n\nfelix <- whip %>% filter(Name == \"Felix Hernandez\")\nbumgarner <- whip %>% filter(Name == \"Madison Bumgarner*\")\nshields <- whip %>% filter(Name == \"James Shields\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=whip, \n    aes(x=Innings, y=TotalWHIP), color=\"grey\",\n    alpha=.5) +\n  geom_point(\n    data=felix, aes(x=Innings, y=TotalWHIP), color=\"#005C5C\"\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data=bumgarner,aes(x=Innings, y=TotalWHIP), color=\"#FD5A1E\"\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data=shields, aes(x=Innings, y=TotalWHIP), color=\"#BD9B60\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels=comma) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=227, y=.91, label=\"Felix Hernandez\"), size=3, color=\"#005C5C\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=207, y=1.09, label=\"Madison Bumgarner\"), size=3, color=\"#FD5A1E\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=235, y=1.18, label=\"James Shields\"), size=3, color=\"#BD9B60\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Innings Pitched\",\n    y=\"WHIP (BB + H) per IP\",\n    title=\"Total WHIP Leaders in 2014\",\n    subtitle=\"James Shields threw a ton of innings, and held a respectable WHIP\",\n    caption=\"Source: https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/majors/2014-standard-pitching.shtml | By: Jackson Reddick\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n    theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nJames Shields threw a ton of innings, which means his WHIP will be a tad inflated, but he showed that he was a quality starting pitcher nonetheless. Felix Hernandez is forgotten so much in MLB history, and his dominance was never loved enough. And there is the devil himself Madison Bumgarner. Yeah we can end with that, go watch 2014 World Series highlights for more details.\nAnother huge stat for me is looking at pitcher’s strikeout to walk ratio, as strikeouts aren’t the most important, but walks are a killer. I wanted to compare Shields to an AL Central great pitcher in Corey Kluber, who when in Cleveland was a damn killer. Kluber was as dominant as they come, but what do the numbers say?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(waffle)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nmlbpitchers <- read_csv(\"2014royalssp.csv\")\n\nshields <- c(\"SO\"=180, 89, \"BB\"=44)\nkluber <- c(\"SO\"=269, \"BB\"=51)\n\niron(\n waffle(shields, \n        rows = 10, \n        title=\"James Shields SO/BB Ratio\", \n        xlab=\"1 square = 1 SO/BB\", \n        colors = c(\"#BD9B60\", \"white\", \"#004687\")\n        ),\n waffle(kluber, \n        rows = 10, \n        title=\"Corey Kluber SO/BB Ratio\", \n        xlab=\"1 square = 1 SO/BB\", \n        colors = c(\"#00385D\", \"#E50022\")\n        )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nKluber dominated Shields in the strikeout department, but Shields still held up with not walking a ton of guys either. One guy uses his dominance to strikeout hitters and one uses finesse to get hitters out. There are multiple ways to win a major league baseball game and both these guys show that.\nIn conclusion the 2014 Kansas City Royals needed James Shields in order to be successful. Was he the man that propelled them to the World Series? Probably not. But was he a key cog in the machine that got the Royals into the Fall Classic? Absolutely."

Yes he had Calvin Johnson for the majority of his Lions career, but I want to focus on ending of Calvin’s career and the post-Calvin years.

But Matthew Stafford made the trio of Golden Tate, Marvin Jones and Kenny Golladay one of the best receiving cores in the NFL. Add in TJ Hockenson in 2020, subtracting Golden Tate, and the Lions had two good WRs and an above average receiving TE.

past or going into the final stages of their respective primes. But Stafford effectively made Kenny Golladay $70+ million in New York, and once again the difference between Jared Goff and Matthew Stafford for Cooper Kupp sheeeeeeeeeeesh.\nLastly, I wanted to check out one of Stafford’s career seasons, which was 2017. If any of you in this room in Lincoln, Nebraska know about the 2017 Detroit Lions like I do, please go get mental care. But to recap, it was Jim Caldwell’s final season in Detroit, the Atlanta Falcons snuck away with a 10-second runoff rule and the Lions went 9-7, which up until 2022 was the Lions latest winning season.\nIn 2017 Stafford threw for 4446 yards, 29 TDs to only 10 INTs, averaging 12 yards per completion. Pretty damn good season for a quarterback wanting to will his team to the playoffs with a messed up throwing hand. But how good to his WR’s stats matchup to the whole league?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nstats <- read_csv(\"2017WRTotals.csv\")\n\nbestwrs <- stats %>% \n  group_by(Team, Player) %>% \n  summarise(\n    Yards=sum(Yds),\n    Targets=sum(Tgt)\n  )\n\ndet <- bestwrs %>% filter(Team == \"DET\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(\n    data=bestwrs, aes(x=Yards, y=Targets), color=\"grey\", \n    alpha=.5) +\n  geom_point(\n    data=det, aes(x=Yards, y=Targets), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=1070, y=120, label=\"Golden Tate\"), size=2, color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=1170, y=107, label=\"Marvin Jones\"), size=2, color=\"red\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=629, y=86, label=\"Eric Ebron\"), size=2, color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=560, y=48, label=\"Kenny Golladay\"), size=2, color=\"dark green\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=512, y=71, label=\"Theo Riddick\"), size=2, color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=420, y=53, label=\"TJ Jones\"), size=2, color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=268, y=35, label=\"Ameer Abdullah GBR\"), size=2, color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=255, y=26, label=\"Darren Fells\"), size=2, color=\"black\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Yards\",\n    y=\"Targets\",\n    title=\"2017 Wide Receiver Leaders in Targets and Yards\",\n    subtitle=\"Matthew Stafford had a career season and helped his guys have some too\",\n    caption=\"Source: https://www.pro-football-reference.com/ | By: Jackson Reddick\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see there a couple dots I didn’t mark in the bottom left corner. In case you really want to know, Zach Zenner, the pride of South Dakota State and now a proud doctor, had 0 targets for 0 yards receiving.\nIn conclusion, Matthew Stafford is an awesome quarterback who deserves every ounce of respect that he has earned. He isn’t a HOF QB yet in my eyes, and now that he has won his SB, I would gladly like the Rams to suck so the Lions get another good 1st round draft pick. I originally thought as a Lions fan that’s all I’d have to care about this season but 1-6 -> 9-8 had me thinking otherwise."

The average YAC per game was 122.20 yards in a game, and Goff was pretty steady in that number, as he played within the scheme the Lions wanted to run. As with Mahomes, a ton of that is just Travis Kelce refusing to be tackled most times.\nBut to really think about Goff’s 2022 season is looking at his touchdowns. Goff was in the top ten of NFL QBs in touchdown passes, but is there more to the story?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nlogs <- read_csv(\"2022nflqbs.csv\")\n\ntouchdowns <- logs |> \n  group_by(Player) |> \n  summarise(touchdowns=sum(TD)\n  ) |> \n  top_n(10, wt=touchdowns) |> \narrange(desc(touchdowns))\n\ntouchdowns |> \n  gt() |> \n  cols_label(\n    touchdowns = \"Passing Touchdowns\"\n  ) |>\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"2022 Top Ten NFL QB TD Passes\",\n    subtitle = \"So Jared Goff is with pretty damn good company\"\n  ) |> tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |> tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |>\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Jackson Reddick  |  **Source:** Pro Football Reference\")\n  ) |> \n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) |> \n  opt_row_striping() |>  \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |> \n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#0076B6\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Player == \"Jared Goff\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      2022 Top Ten NFL QB TD Passes\n    \n    \n      So Jared Goff is with pretty damn good company\n    \n    \n      Player\n      Passing Touchdowns\n    \n  \n  \n    Patrick Mahomes\n41\n    Joe Burrow\n35\n    Josh Allen\n35\n    Geno Smith\n30\n    Jared Goff\n29\n    Kirk Cousins\n29\n    Aaron Rodgers\n26\n    Justin Herbert\n25\n    Tom Brady\n25\n    Trevor Lawrence\n25\n    Tua Tagovailoa\n25\n  \n  \n    \n      By: Jackson Reddick  |  Source: Pro Football Reference\n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nSo looking at this you’d think, eh Goff played a good year, but 29 touchdowns on a top ten NFL offense, where did all the other touchdowns go?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nlogs2 <- read_csv(\"nfl2022rbs.csv\")\n\ntouchdowns2 <- logs2 |> \n  group_by(Player) |> \n  summarise(touchdowns=sum(TD)\n  ) |> \n  top_n(10, wt=touchdowns) |> \narrange(desc(touchdowns))\n\ntouchdowns2 |> \n  gt() |> \n  cols_label(\n    touchdowns = \"Rushing Touchdowns\"\n  ) |>\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"2022 Top Ten NFL RB Rushing TDs\",\n    subtitle = \"So Jared Goff could have thrown a lot more touchdowns...\"\n  ) |> tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |> tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |>\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Jackson Reddick  |  **Source:** Pro Football Reference\")\n  ) |> \n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) |> \n  opt_row_striping() |>  \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |> \n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#0076B6\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Player == \"Jamaal Williams\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      2022 Top Ten NFL RB Rushing TDs\n    \n    \n      So Jared Goff could have thrown a lot more touchdowns...\n    \n    \n      Player\n      Rushing Touchdowns\n    \n  \n  \n    Jamaal Williams\n17\n    Austin Ekeler\n13\n    Derrick Henry\n13\n    Ezekiel Elliott\n12\n    Josh Jacobs\n12\n    Nick Chubb\n12\n    Miles Sanders\n11\n    Saquon Barkley\n10\n    Kenneth Walker III\n9\n    Tony Pollard\n9\n  \n  \n    \n      By: Jackson Reddick  |  Source: Pro Football Reference\n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nSo Jared Goff played a hell of a 2022 season, and franly could have had a ton of more TDs through the air.
