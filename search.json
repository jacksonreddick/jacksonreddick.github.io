    "text": "But as good as Matthew Stafford was for the Lions, he elevated the play of all his wide receivers. Yes he had Calvin Johnson for the majority of his Lions career, but I want to focus on ending of Calvin’s career and the post-Calvin years. Undoubtedly, Calvin Johnson is a top 5 WR in NFL history and I won’t debate that with anyone. But Matthew Stafford made the trio of Golden Tate, Marvin Jones and Kenny Golladay one of the best receiving cores in the NFL. Add in TJ Hockenson in 2020, subtracting Golden Tate, and the Lions had two good WRs and an above average receiving TE. Then when Matthew Stafford was traded to the Rams, he made Cooper Kupp the 2nd coming of Christ.\nBut how did their best years elsewhere compare to their best year with Matthew Stafford?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nstats <- read_csv(\"MatthewStaffordStats.csv\")\n\nallthosereceivers <- stats %>% mutate(Team = case_when(Tm == \"DET\" ~ \"Lions\", TRUE ~

how far Kenney Golladay fell off a complete map after leaving the graces of Matthew Stafford.\nBut so after looking at the total TD’s along with other stats, how do the career yards stack up against

entered Detroit just past or going into the final stages of their respective primes. But Stafford effectively made Kenny Golladay $70+ million in New York, and once again the difference between Jared Goff and Matthew Stafford for Cooper Kupp sheeeeeeeeeeesh.\nLastly, I wanted to check out one of Stafford’s career seasons, which was 2017. If any of you in this room knows about the 2017 Detroit Lions like I do, please go get mental care. But to recap, it was Jim Caldwell’s final season in Detroit, the Atlanta Falcons snuck away with a 10-second runoff rule and the Lions went 9-7 and hired Matt Patricia the next season. Yeah. Sound familiar? You see why I hate the weekends in the fall?\nIn 2017 Stafford threw for 4446 yards, 29 TDs to only 10 INTs, averaging 12 yards per completion. Pretty damn good season for a quarterback wanting to will his team to the playoffs. But how good to his WR’s stats matchup to the whole league?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nstats <- read_csv(\"2017WRTotals.csv\")\n\nbestwrs <- stats %>% \n  group_by(Team, Player) %>% \n  summarise(\n    Yards=sum(Yds),\n    Targets=sum(Tgt)\n  )\n\ndet <- bestwrs %>% filter(Team == \"DET\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(\n    data=bestwrs, aes(x=Yards, y=Targets), color=\"grey\", \n    alpha=.5) +\n  geom_point(\n    data=det, aes(x=Yards, y=Targets), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=1070, y=120, label=\"Golden Tate\"), size=2, color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=1170, y=107, label=\"Marvin Jones\"), size=2, color=\"red\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=629, y=86, label=\"Eric Ebron\"), size=2, color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=560, y=48, label=\"Kenny Golladay\"), size=2, color=\"dark green\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=512, y=71, label=\"Theo Riddick\"), size=2, color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=420, y=53, label=\"TJ Jones\"), size=2, color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=268, y=35, label=\"Ameer Abdullah GBR\"), size=2, color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=255, y=26, label=\"Darren Fells\"), size=2, color=\"black\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Yards\",\n    y=\"Targets\",\n    title=\"2017 Wide Receiver Leaders in Targets and Yards\",\n    subtitle=\"Matthew Stafford had a career season and helped his guys have some too\",\n    caption=\"Source: https://www.pro-football-reference.com/ | By: Jackson Reddick\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see there a couple dots I didn’t mark in the bottom left corner. In case you really want to know, Zach Zenner, the pride of South Dakota State and now a proud doctor, had 0 targets for 0 yards receiving.\nIn conclusion, Matthew Stafford is an awesome quarterback who deserves every ounce of respect that he has earned. He isn’t a HOF QB yet in my eyes, and now that he has won his SB, I would gladly like the Rams to suck so the Lions get another good 1st round draft pick. This is what we have to get excited about as Lions fans."
